## Overview

This repository mirrors your active project on [v0.app](https://v0.app).  
Every update you make inside v0 is automatically committed and synced here, ensuring your landing page code stays up-to-date with your deployed version.

## Deployment

Your live project is available at:

**[https://vercel.com/pawarsmit2108-gmailcoms-projects/v0-learn-pro-landing-page](https://vercel.com/pawarsmit2108-gmailcoms-projects/v0-learn-pro-landing-page)**

## Build Your App

You can continue editing and evolving your project directly on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/iOyLfZdXZrn](https://v0.app/chat/iOyLfZdXZrn)**

## How It Works

1. Build and refine your landing page through the [v0.app](https://v0.app) interface  
2. Deploy your changes directly from v0  
3. Every deployment automatically syncs code into this repository  
4. Vercel picks up the latest version from Git and deploys it instantly
